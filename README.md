# Tc3_Component
A library for TwinCAT 3 which ist using design patterns to standardize machine control software.\
The goal are to code reliable Software in a short time,\
have a lightwight and modular Framework.

Inspired by Frameworks like [SPT-Libraries](https://github.com/Beckhoff-USA-Community/SPT-Libraries) or [TcOpen](https://docs.tcopengroup.org/)

## Description
    [x] State Machine (ISA88/MTP)
    [x] Command Pattern to change component states
    [x] Observer Pattern to Notify state changes
    [x] Event Funktion to build and log Events
    [x] Eventlogger
    [x] Sequence Function Block
    [ ] Ethercat Monitoring
    [ ] Device Function Blocks ==> will probably have its own lib
    [ ] Axis Function Blocks ==> will probably have its own lib
    [ ] Dictionary function block with Tc3_JsonXml
